## 1.
Problem 4.3 in the text.

## 2.
Problem 4.4 in the text.
When `y` is numeric, what argument to `createDataPartition` controls how the stratified sample is generated?
Explain how this works.

## 3.
Using the `Glass` dataset from the previous homework, perform each of the following resampling techniques.  Start each part (a,b,c) from the full dataset (i.e. these are separate, not sequential questions).

a). Split the data using a simple test/train split.

b). Split the data using 3-fold cross validation.

c). Split the data using bootstrapping.

For each split, use `head()` to print the first few rows of the training set and the test set.
In total you should have printed 10 data sets.
